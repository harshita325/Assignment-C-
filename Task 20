-- Option 1: If DestinationTable is empty or you want to completely overwrite its contents
-- (Use with caution as this will delete all existing data in DestinationTable)
-- TRUNCATE TABLE DestinationTable; -- Resets table and quickly deletes all rows.
-- OR
-- DELETE FROM DestinationTable;    -- Deletes rows one by one, logs transactions.

INSERT INTO DestinationTable (column1, column2, column3, ...)
SELECT column1, column2, column3, ...
FROM SourceTable;

-- Option 2: If you want to copy all columns and the table structures are identical
-- (More concise if all columns are to be copied in the same order)
INSERT INTO DestinationTable
SELECT *
FROM SourceTable;
